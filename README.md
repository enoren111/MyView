# Overview 📁
Sesame Street is a popular educational series on TV. However, teenagers nowadays convert their focus to
social media instead of TV. 
We think it is possible to build a new software which can generate
programming teaching content by using LLM. The creator can adjust the content based on the scripts
and then upload it to different social media platforms. The software will allow scripting of both human
and virtual LLM based characters (like muppets in the Sesame Street world). 
This software will be implemented in full-stack by calling APIs from LLM. The software will support playing back the scripts
easily in the different platforms with LLM being used to fill in the parts that humans will play as well to
help with authoring episodes. 
All the functions will be integrated in our community - **Sesuyu Street**.
